    During the writing and review process, I used a variety of tools to improve the quality of the text. Some of these tools use natural language processing to provide suggestions for the sake of improving the text. For transparency, I have listed the tools I used below:

        \item[Github Copilot] Github Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that provides suggestions for writing code. It was used to help with the graphics and to help find the right words for the text.
